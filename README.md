## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to quantify the impact of various marketing channels on sales using Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM). It also provides a scenario simulation engine and a budget optimization tool to help businesses make data-driven advertising investment decisions.

## Business Problem

Marketing teams often struggle to understand the true return on investment (ROI) of their media spend across different channels like TV, radio, digital, influencers, and out-of-home (OOH) advertising. Without clear insight, budget decisions can be inefficient and reactive.

## Project Objectives

- Estimate how much each marketing channel contributes to sales.
- Model adstock effects (delayed impact of ads).
- Simulate "what-if" scenarios (e.g., increase digital spend by 20%).
- Optimize media budget to maximize ROI or total sales.
